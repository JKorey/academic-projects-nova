 * This class represents the driver for the EmployeeException class.
 * The driver program uses an array that can hold up to 100 employees (
 * the array will be of EmployeeException type).
 * The user should be free to enter as many employees as needed.
 * The driver class should use two exception classes to signal the user that the SSN entered is not correct. * SSN needs to be entered as a  9-digit string without separators.
