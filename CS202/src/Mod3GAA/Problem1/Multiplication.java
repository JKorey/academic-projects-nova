    The Base-Case Question: Is there a non-recursive way out of the algorithm, and does the algorithm work correctly for this base case?

    Yes, if a or b = 0, then 0 is returned

    The Smaller-Caller Question: Does each recursive call to the algorithm involve a smaller case of the original problem, leading inescapably to the base case?

    Yes, Recursive calls of a will reduce by a-1 until it equals 0, which is the base case.


    The General-Case Question: Assuming the recursive call(s) to the smaller case(s) works correctly, does the algorithm work correctly for the general case?

    yes, the base case id b + (a-1, b) which will return a * b for any positive value of a or b.
